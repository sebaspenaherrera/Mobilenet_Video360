# Mobilenet Video360

Mobilenet Video360 is a **Unity-based testbed** developed with **Unity 2022.3** for evaluating **360-video streaming services**.  
The project is designed to extract **Key Quality Indicators (KQIs)** that characterize the user experience of video playback.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: KQIs differ from KPIs.  
- **KQIs (Key Quality Indicators)** ‚Üí End-user Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics.  
- **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)** ‚Üí Network-side performance metrics.  

---

## üìå Features
- Unity 2022.3 project for immersive **360-video playback**.  
- Extraction of detailed **KQIs** (video, network, resolution, frame rate, media, and player state).  
- Demo/testbed to validate streaming quality in controlled scenarios.  

---

## üìÇ Project Structure
- **`Assets/Scripts/KQI_group.cs`** ‚Üí Main file where all KQIs are defined.  
- **Unity Scenes & Prefabs** ‚Üí Manage playback and interaction.  
- **Networking/Video Components** ‚Üí Integrates with playback service for data collection.

**Note 1:** You can get some KPIs by using the transport network API. If you are using Amari-based software, you may be interested in: [API Amari](https://github.com/sebaspenaherrera/api-amari).
**Note 2:** Additionally, you can gather some metrics from the CPE. To do so, you need to configure the credentials and make sure the API procedure is similar. This has been tested with Huawei CPE Pro 2.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download)  
- Unity **2022.3 LTS** installed.  

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sebaspenaherrera/Mobilenet_Video360.git

2. Open the project in Unity 2022.3.

3. Load the scenes provided in the project.

## üìå Usage

- Run the demo scene in the Unity editor or build for your target device. By default, Meta Quest 2. If the device is different, recompile the code following the providers' suggestions
- Configure the App
  * Point to the right API for data collection
  * Select the video
  * Enable/Disable the CPE metric with the toggle.
    +  **Note**: This will enable a new menu screen to configure CPE's API endpoint and credentials. 
- Play a 360-video stream and gather some interesting metrics!

- **Optional**: Monitor and log KQIs for performance evaluation. By default, you can use [360-video WebUI](https://github.com/sebaspenaherrera/Video360_WebUI).
